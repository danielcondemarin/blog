Many companies and engineers today appreciate the value provided by pair programming. It brings benefits such as **increased code quality**, **less defects**, **knowledge transfer**, **improved team communication** to name a few.
This post isn't about the perks of pair programming though, instead, I'll be writing about some of the challenges we can encounter as individuals during pairing and hopefully give some tips to help you overcome these. We'll also see how important Emotional Intelligence is to pair programming, and how we can improve our skills in this area, by just increasing our awareness.

As software engineers, we do amazing things, we build impressive applications every day and we should be proud of that. Unfortunately one skill that we don't get taught or consciously improve is our Emotional Intelligence, which I think is critical for good pair programming.

I've been particularly interested in this topic over the last year or so, and I've recently completed a great book by Daniel Goleman titled: _Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ_. Goleman synthesizes Emotional Intelligence in the following 4 pillars:

- Self-Awareness
- Self-Management
- Empathy
- Social / Relationship Skills

I believe that by improving our Emotional Intelligence skills we can become much better pair programmers, so let's break it down in parts:

### Self-Awareness

Self-awareness is about knowing what we're feeling and why we're feeling it. Is a monitor of our own thoughts and feelings.

During pairing, exchanges of opposite views happen all the time. One of these exchanges can lead to heated arguments, for example, you both are very opinionated about how you should structure directories in your project, or maybe what framework to use for unit testing, etc. While is important to have these discussions, which ultimately could lead to a wonderful solution, is also important to **notice** your own first signs of negative emotions, especially when the argument escalates: anxiety, frustration, stress, etc. Being self aware in these moments means that you will be better off at reacting and doing something about it, such as **taking a break**, going for a cup of tea or maybe just switching topics for 10 minutes and talk about the fun stuff you've been up to lately. Acting on time in these situations can stop the build up of stress and bring it back down.

### Self-Management

Self-management allows us to control our **impulses**, or keeping disruptive emotions in check. It's also about being able to marshall positive emotions and remaining optimistic despite obstacles.

This skill is probably the most important when pairing and it could be useful in many situations. For example, one of the most difficult things to achieve during pairing: **Explaining your thoughts out loud over and over again**, as many times as your pair needs in order for the both of you to be in _sync_. This can be very difficult, especially when there are different levels of experience in the pair on the task at hand. Giving in to emotion in this sort of situation is easy, letting the frustration take over and lead us to go in our own train of thoughts, disregarding your pair from any opinion, which will have negative long lasting effects in your communication.
Self-management can also manifest in another crucial part of pairing: **Patience to listen**, the capacity to keep ourselves engaged and focused in the conversation can be particularly challenging with all the distractions we have today: mobile phones, social media, email and so on.

### Empathy

There are 3 different types of empathy: cognitive, emotional and empathic concern.

Cognitive empathy refers to how well we can perceive and understand the emotions of another. Emotional empathy is how well we can put ourselves in another's shoes, and empathic concern is what do we _actually_ do about it.

Remember what I said earlier about monitoring your _own_ first signs of negative emotions? Well, as you probably imagine empathy allows us to detect the same signs in our pair. Being adept at this skill means that we can easily notice when our pair partner is having a bad time, not quite focused in the task at hand or just not having a good day. It is very important what we do after noticing, going for that cup of tea or taking that break could make all the difference.

### Social / Relationship Skills

**How do I respond to other peopleâ€™s emotions?**, **How good am I in attuning to other's emotions?** These are abilities that conform the basis of good social skills.

Being able to build healthy relationships with the people we pair with is very important. As a result, you will find smoother pairing experiences.
