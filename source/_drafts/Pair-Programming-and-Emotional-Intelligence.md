title: Pair Programming and Emotional Intelligence

The value provided by pair programming today, is appreciated by many companies and engineers. A study done by the University of Utah https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/XPSardinia.PDF found that whilst increasing development time costs by 15%, pair programming also improves **design quality**, **reduces defects**, **reduces staffing risk**, **facilitates knowledge transfer** and enhances **team communication**.
This post isn't about the perks of pair programming though, instead, I'll be writing about some of the challenges we can encounter as individuals during pairing and hopefully give some tips to help you overcome these. We'll see how important Emotional Intelligence is to pair programming, and how we can improve our skills in this area, by just increasing our awareness.

Unfortunately, as software engineers, one skill that we don't get taught or consciously improve on is our Emotional Intelligence, which I think is critical for good pair programming.

I've been particularly interested in this topic over the last year or so, and I've recently completed a great book by Daniel Goleman titled: _Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ_. Goleman synthesizes Emotional Intelligence in the following 4 pillars:

- Self-Awareness
- Self-Management
- Empathy
- Social / Relationship Skills

I believe that by improving our Emotional Intelligence skills we can become much better pair programmers, so let's have a look at the first three pillars:

### Self-Awareness

Self-awareness is about knowing what we're feeling and why we're feeling it. Is a monitor of our own thoughts and feelings.

During pairing, exchanges of opposite views happen all the time. One of these exchanges can lead to arguments, for example, you both differ on how you should design some new component you're implementing, even how to structure directories in your project, or maybe what library to use to solve a problem. These upfront discussions is one of the upsides of pairing, as it can save you from making a mistake, but can also sometimes escalate and be quite draining or heated, especially when you're both very opinionated and are struggling to agree.**Noticing** your first signs of negative emotions, such as stress, frustration or anxiety is very important. Being self aware in these moments means that you will be better off at reacting and doing something about it, such as **taking a break**, going for **a cup of tea** or maybe just switching topics for 10 minutes and talk about the fun stuff you've been up to lately. Acting on time in these situations can stop the build up of stress and bring it back down.

### Self-Management

Self-management allows us to control our **impulses**, or keeping disruptive emotions in check. It's also about being able to marshall positive emotions and remaining optimistic despite obstacles.

This skill is probably the most important when pairing and it could be useful in many situations. For example, one of the most difficult things to achieve during pairing: **Explaining your thoughts out loud**, as many times as your pair needs in order for the both of you to be in _sync_. This can be difficult sometimes, especially when one in the pair lacks experience on the task at hand or you're just not explaining yourself well. Giving in to emotion in this sort of situation is easy, letting the frustration take over and lead us to go in our own train of thoughts, disregarding your pair from any opinion, which can have negative long lasting effects in your communication.
Self-management can also manifest itself in another crucial part of pairing: **Patience to listen**, the capacity to keep ourselves engaged and focused in the conversation can be particularly challenging with all the distractions we have today: mobile phones, social media, email and so on.

### Empathy

There are 3 different types of empathy: cognitive, emotional and empathic concern.

Cognitive empathy refers to how well we can perceive and understand the emotions of another. Emotional empathy is how well we can put ourselves in another's shoes, and empathic concern is what do we _actually_ do about it.

Remember what I said earlier about monitoring your _own_ first signs of negative emotions? Well, empathy allows us to detect the same signs in our pair. Being adept at this skill means that we can easily notice when our pair partner is having a bad time, not quite focused in the task at hand or just not having a good day. It is very important what we do after noticing, suggesting going for that cup of tea or taking that break could make all the difference.

### Final Thoughts

Over many years the stereotype of a programmer sitting alone in a room and coding on their own might have been relatively accurate, but today with the popularity of practices such as agile software development and pair programming this is far from the truth. We have daily interactions with other people that require not just having good technical skills or an average to high IQ, it also requires some degree of **people skills**, not only in management positions but also as practicing engineers.
